**Vuejs//Berlin 2022-04**

the last(?) online meetup! Come into our cyber space and start socializing, have virtual drinks, play games and listen to talks!

**TALK**

* *Ruby on Rails, together with Vue3 and Vite as Full Stack solution* by Jiří

**Code of Conduct**
We follow the Berlin Code Of Conduct and expect every attendee to do the same. More details can be found on [berlincodeofconduct.org](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/).

**Additional Info**
We are using [gather.town](https://gather.town) for our online event. It allows virtual socializing in much better way than simple streaming. If you are new to this kind of meeting don't worry! There will be a short tutorial to explain everything. The meeting space opens half an hour before the event start, so feel free to take your time to customize your avatar, look around the venue and maybe play some games on the vintage game stations.
