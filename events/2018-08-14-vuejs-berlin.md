** DYNAMIC FORMS WITH VUE — Darek Wędrychowski **

Forms are among the most common web app elements, but the amount of boilerplate we write for them can be exhausting. Luckily, with Vue we can write forms that are reusable, dynamically generated and flexible enough to use with any UI library or custom templating. Let's talk about how to deal with common pitfalls related to dynamic forms and see how to write a form generator from scratch.

This talk will be held by Darek Wędrychowski from Kraków, probably better known as Gusto, the helping hand in VueLand ( https://chat.vuejs.org ).

We will have Coffee, Mate, Beer …and maybe Pizza!
