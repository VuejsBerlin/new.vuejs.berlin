Lets talk about Vue.js, Vuex and the Vuejs ecosystem.

1. Oscar - Accessible input validation

About the talk: Input validation is the cornerstone of every web form ever. While this has historically been a drag, nowadays libraries like Vuelidate make it easy.
With validation out of the way, developers can use their time to build interfaces that are accessible and easy to use. Building an input component, Oscar will introduce you to the ARIA guidelines and how they help to build a Web that can be used by all humans.

About the speaker: Oscar writes code. He designs for web and print. He cares about accessibility, usability & performance. He is a typophile. He doesn’t specialize in pop art. He likes to think. And owls.
