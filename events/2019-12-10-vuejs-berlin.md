Lets talk about Vue.js the Vue.js ecosystem!

**** Presentation ****

Alexander Conrad from Universal Music will tell us about the Vuejs based SDK they built for internal uses:
Universal started to use Vue two years ago for their internal applications in the context of data visualization. From there a visualization library has been developed which is now embedded in a containerized Vue template to make development of new tools easy for the whole company.

Vinicius Kiatkoski Neves will have a short talk about Securing your component library with visual testing.

Everyone is invited to have a Lightning Talk about whatever project or idea they want to talk about. Just approach us and we make it happen!

We will have Coffee, Mate, Beer â€¦and probably Pizza!

**** Code of Conduct ****
We follow the Berlin Code Of Conduct and expect every attendee to do the same. More details can be found on http://berlincodeofconduct.org .
