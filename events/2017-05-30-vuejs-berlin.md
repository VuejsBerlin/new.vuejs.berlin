Lets talk about Vue.js!

As always the round will be open for any topics and ideas around the Vue.js ecosystem. This time there is no specific topic. If you have anything in mind, just bring it up. There are usually some pretty experienced Vuejs users in the room, well mixed with newcomers and everything in-between. So don't hesitate to ask questions, tell us about your project idea and/or problems.
