This meetup is co-sponsored by Car2Go and Sumit from Car2Go will talk about serverless deployment of frontend apps!

Later on the evening we will all together draw numbers to determine the winners of the Vuejs Berlin End-Of-Year raffle!

As always there will also be an open round for any topics and ideas around the Vue.js ecosystem. Discussions, Questions, Project ideas and spontaneous short presentations are welcome.
