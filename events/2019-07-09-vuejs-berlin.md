Lets talk about Vue.js and the Vue.js ecosystem!

— This time at Homeday —

**** Presentations ****

Vinicius Kiatkoski Neves from Homday will talk about Brotli compression and how they used it in one of their projects. He'll show us the benefits and the challenges of implementing it with CloudFront.

Emre Karaca from Easybell.de will compare Vue.js, Nuxt.js and Gridsome, how they deal with dynamic content/data and how they differ in what they send to the browser by looking at a few easy-to-understand examples.

We will have Coffee, Mate, Beer …and maybe Pizza!

**** Code of Conduct ****
We follow the Berlin Code Of Conduct and expect every attendee to do the same. More details can be found on http://berlincodeofconduct.org .
