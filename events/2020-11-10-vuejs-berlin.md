Details:
Vue 3 was released 2 months ago. It might be a bit early to migrate our Vue 2 applications with Vue 3 but it does not mean we can not enjoy the powerful and exciting features that Vue 3 brings on the table. Among these, the Composition API offers a new way to compose and handle components logic. After quickly introducing the hottest features from Vue 3, we will focus on the composition API and show you how to use it within an app written in Vue 2 style.

If you want, you can have Coffee, Mate, Beer â€¦and even Pizza... at home, while watching our live stream.
