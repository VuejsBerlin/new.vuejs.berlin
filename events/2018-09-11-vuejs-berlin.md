**** Presentation ****

Design Systems are super hype now. Atlassian, Sketch, Google are using it, even GOV.UK has their own design system.

Most people think the design system is only important to designers, but there are so many similarities between the project structure and design system.

Junyu @3YOURMIND created their design system called "Kotti". The creator and designer would like to share their experience and method during the design and development.

And as always lets talk about Vue.js and the Vuejs ecosystem.

We will have drinks and Pizza!
