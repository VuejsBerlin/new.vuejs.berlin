    <strong>Taproot - How Ecosia built their own web app framework, and why you should, too!</strong>
  </summary>
  <p>"Build our own framework" sounds like something out of a small company CTO's worst nightmare. Unless you're a huge tech corporation, it is usually best practice to use existing frameworks and focus on implementing features. However, a number of recent libraries and tools are helping us rethink what a framework really is, empowering us to take more control of our tech stacks while improving performance and maintainability. In this talk, I'm going to show you why (and how) we built Taproot, an in-house Vue SSR framework at Ecosia; our design decisions, pitfalls and shifts in mindset; and how this helped us improve Web vitals on our Images vertical by up to 25%.</p>
