Lets talk about Vue.js, Vuex and the Vuejs ecosystem.

**** Presentation ****
tl;dr
* static vs dynamic typing
* game programming with vuejs

We'll have a short lightning talk about static types vs dynamic types. It will be fun, promised!

And because not everyone was able to attend the Vuejs Roadtrip main event, Norman will once again have his talk about his game development journey with Vuejs!

We will have Coffee, Mate, Beer â€¦and maybe Pizza!
