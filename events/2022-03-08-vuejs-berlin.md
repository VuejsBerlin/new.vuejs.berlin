Lets talk about Vue.js the Vue.js ecosystem! In a virtual pixel-art world! With cute little pets! And even more exclamation mark worthy things!

No Presentation. This will be a purely social gathering. But we're open for any lightning talks.

You will have Coffee, Mate, Beer and Pizza ...if you order it for yourself!
