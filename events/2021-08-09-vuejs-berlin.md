Lets talk about Vue.js the Vue.js ecosystem!

**** Presentation ****
Currently it looks like there will be no presentation. In case nobody steps forward and offers to have a talk, we will simply have a small round for discussion with some pizza and drinks. If you have questions, issues, ideas, anything, feel free to ask!

**** Code of Conduct ****
We follow the Berlin Code Of Conduct and expect every attendee to do the same. More details can be found on http://berlincodeofconduct.org .

**** Corona ****
We follow the current regulations regarding small, public events during the pandemic. Every attendee will need a proof of either:
* a negative test from the same day (not 24h!),
* full vaccination,
* full recovery.
In addition to this medical masks need to be worn whenever someone is moving around and we need to log every visitor either via app or via a simple form.

There will be a limited amount of self-tests and masks available.
