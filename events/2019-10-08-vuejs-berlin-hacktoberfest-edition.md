Talk
====
Surviving with Git: Undoing Things and Recovering from Mistakes by Tobias Günther.

We cannot avoid mistakes. But with the right tools, we can make sure they don't hurt too much. Git offers many ways to undo, revert, recover and fix. We'll look at the bad things that can happen to you - and how Git can save your neck.

About the speaker
==================
Tobias Günther is the founder and CEO of "Tower", a popular desktop GUI for Git on Mac and Windows (www.git-tower.com). For many years, he has been helping people become more productive and confident with Git and version control - for example with his book "Learn Version Control with Git" and of course with "Tower".

Hacktoberfest
==============

We will explain the idea behind the yearly Hacktoberfest and how everyone can help making Open Source contributions. There are several sources where you can find projects and we will show you some projects that include Vuejs or Javascript in general.

— Code of Conduct —
We follow the Berlin Code Of Conduct and expect every attendee to do the same. More details can be found on http://berlincodeofconduct.org .
For this special event we ask you to also check the event specific Code Of Conduct. It is largely compatible with ours though: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gFKOhyUqMZzrZcbq8A_TpO5x9J9HK6agv70awCH8pyI
