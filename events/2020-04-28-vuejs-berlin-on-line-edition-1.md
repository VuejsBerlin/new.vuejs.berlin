Our first edition of on-line meetup. Lets talks about Vue.js from safety and comfort of our houses.

**** Presentation ****
1. Tarun Mangukiya - Optimizing Nuxt

2. Samuel Snopko - Blazingly Fast - Going headless with Nuxt!

This will be fast & furious! I will show you the fastest possible way to connect your Nuxt.js project to Storyblok CMS and deploy it in seconds. You should know a thing or two about Nuxt.js, headless CMS or JAMstack as there will be no time to describe the concepts in detail. In the end, you will be furious how insanely good the Nuxt.js & Storyblok combo is!

3. Norman & Jiri - Ask us anything session

**** What else ****
We will be streaming via our Youtube channel:
