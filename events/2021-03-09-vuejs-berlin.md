**** Presentation ****

1) Daniel Kuroski - Encoding and decoding IO operations in the front end.

We face a lot of unpredictable situations, especially by dealing with data coming from outside of our apps, so runtime errors and inconsistent UI states are something we deal with our a daily basis.

Daniel wants to present something simple that people can do to reduce the headache of dealing with those problems.

And what we also can do to go to the next level to create safer applications.

He loves to spend time with his wife and cat called Anabelle, and most of my free time he is programming... He also loves doing things in Elm, the topics He has the most interest in are
- testing in the front end
