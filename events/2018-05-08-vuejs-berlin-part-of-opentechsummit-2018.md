Vue.js // Berlin is happy to be part of the OpenTechSummit Festival (https://opentechsummit.net) with this meetup.

We'll talk about Vue.js, Vuex and the Vuejs ecosystem.

**** Presentations ****

1. OpenTechSummit short presentation

2. Michele - Token based Authentication

Authentication is often one of the most critical parts of modern applications, even and often especially in bigger ones. Much has changed in the last years and many applications moved from a traditional cookie-session-based to a more modern token-based approach. But this opened a new class of challenges and threats.
Together we will take a look at the main features of authentication tokens, with the security threats coming from XSS and CSRF attacks and how to mitigate them. Some code samples will also be given on how to securely exchange tokens between a NodeJs server and a VueJs based client.
