A workflow for building the web in the web:

In this talk we are gonna build an app that prints Kanye west quotes for your saddest days using Vue, set up GitHub for it and deploy it to production all within the browser to see the potential of The Platform ™️

Animate your way to Glory:

What if animation on the web was as expressive as CG animation? What if we went beyond simple UI transitions, and opened our craft up to detailed and intricate motion?
In this talk, I'll introduce you to a new tool (disclaimer: I made it) that helps you create beautiful motion graphics that render live on the web. I'll also show you how to integrate it with Vue, so that you can bring this joy to all parts of your Vue apps!

Aria makes tools to bring designers and developers closer together. He tweets about this stuff at @ariaminaei
