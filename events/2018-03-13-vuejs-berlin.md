Lets talk about Vue.js, Vuex and the Vuejs ecosystem.

**** Presentation ****

** Yaw Boakye - Loading data into a Single Page Application **

Loading data into a Single Page Application and keeping it fresh is fraught with errors. During the talk we'll explore patterns for loading data (and refreshing them in the background or in the main thread) and how it affects route transitions.

We'll also take a good look at Vuex and the Vue Router and ways to make them work together for our users.
