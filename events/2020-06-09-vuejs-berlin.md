Lets talk about Vue.js the Vue.js ecosystem!

**** Presentation ****

** Atharva Sharma - Let’s talk Lifecycle hooks in Vue **

Atharva builds engaging and high performance user interfaces that translate to a great experience and ultimately to high user conversions (one of his clients saw a growth of 617%).

In this talk, he’ll walk us through the complete Vue lifecycle, how he makes the most out of it, and how you can do the same to build battle-proof Frontends.

Working as an independent consultant, Atharva likes writing readable and oftentimes simple solutions to complex problems. He tries to keep most of his work open-source so that others can benefit from it too!
