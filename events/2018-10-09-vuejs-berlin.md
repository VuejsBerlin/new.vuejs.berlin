* 2 * Peter Leonov - Instrumented unit testing with Introscope

Testing a complex and ever changing business logic can be tuff and demotivating, but only without the good tooling and automation. In this talk we'll discover the even more automated way of testing modern JS code using the combination of ES6 modules, a handy babel plugin and the delightful power of jest snapshots.

Peter Leonov is a JS developer since IE 6 was a hot new browser. He likes the way the modern JavaScript has evolved and wants to push it even further.

We will have Coffee, Mate, Beer â€¦and maybe Pizza!
