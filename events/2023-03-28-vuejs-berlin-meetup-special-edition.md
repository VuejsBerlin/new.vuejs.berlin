Hey all #vuers

So tomorrow 28th March at 18:00 CEST.
Jiri will talk [@nuxt_js](https://twitter.com/nuxt_js) and [@strapijs](https://twitter.com/strapijs), so if you missed the talk at the real-life meetup now there is your chance

Then Jiri and with Norman will talk about Webexpo Conference in Prague and Node Congress in Berlin

In the end, we will raffle free tickets for these two conferences.
