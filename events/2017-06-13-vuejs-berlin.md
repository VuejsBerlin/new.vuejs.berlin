Lets talk about Vue.js! And Moon.js!

Moon.js is for Vue what Preact is for React. It is tiny (5kb or so) and feels very similar to Vue.js.

As always the round will be open for any topics and ideas around the Vue.js ecosystem. We will have Coffee, Mate, Beer and maybe Pizza!

Notice: We have ongoing reconstruction in our office. Please use Aufgang E only. Thanks.
