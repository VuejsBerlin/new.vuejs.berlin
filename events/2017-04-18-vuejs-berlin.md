This Meetup day is for all who are new to Vue.js.

Wolfram, co-founder of deepstreamhub.com ( https://vuejs.org/v2/examples/deepstream.html ) will be talking about building realtime apps with Vue.

Creativity pushed, we will go into the hack-n-tell mode, talk about, show and create new projects.

Oh, and there will be Pizza and Beer!
