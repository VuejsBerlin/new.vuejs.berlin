Let's talk about Vue.js and the Vue.js ecosystem!
This meetup is sponsored and hosted by Honeypot and we are also community partners of [Vuejs.de Conf](https://conf.vuejs.de) and this is the reason we are breaking our "second Tuesday" rule ;-)

\*\*\*\* Presentation \*\*\*\*

1. **Konstantin BIFERT** \- Vue \+ 3D \(via ThreeJS/TroisJS\) \+ some Tensorflow
2. **Jiri Kratochvil** \- My short Story\(book\) about Histoire

We will have Coffee, Mate, Beer â€¦and probably Pizza!

\*\*\*\* Code of Conduct \*\*\*\*
We follow the Berlin Code Of Conduct and expect every attendee to do the same. More details can be found on http://berlincodeofconduct.org .
