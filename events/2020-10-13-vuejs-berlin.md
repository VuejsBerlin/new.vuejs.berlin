Vinicius Kiatkoski Neves - Go async in Vue 3 with Suspense

Vue 3 is coming with some exciting new features. Composition API is the hottest one at the moment but there are others that excite me as much as it. One of those new features is called Suspense and it really excites me about the benefits it brings. You might have heard about it already but I will try to show some examples of the usage of Suspense and where it can be beneficial.

We will have Coffee, Mate, Beer â€¦and probably Pizza!
